# Defending-for-Claude-Ai

## Introduction

We will start by introducing Claude AI, developed by Anthropic whilst many more will follow in its atonomous orchestration footsteps. While notintended to be a malicious tool, its capabilities can be exploited by threat actors to assist in reconnaissance, automate decision-making, and facilitate lateral movement. Claude does not propagate like traditional malware; instead, it is often embedded in scripts, invoked via APIs due to size, or used to interpret system feedback in real time.

This document outlines detection and isolation strategies using pre-existing tools but you will not be able to catch it in the conventional way rather you need to identify behavour and be able to distinguish anomalies.

## Understanding Claude's Movement

Claude AI operates as a cognitive layer within malicious workflows. It does not scan or infect systems directly. Instead, it:

- Interprets system responses
- Generates adaptive commands
- Assists in phishing and payload generation
- Operates through API calls or embedded scripts

Its presence is subtle, often manifesting through behavioral anomalies rather than signature-based indicators.

## Detection Strategies with Microsoft Sentinel

### 1. Monitoring Outbound Connections

**Objective:** Identify devices communicating with Claude-related domains, especially outside business hours.

**Query Description:**  
"Alert me every time Claude AI is run from a device whose MAC address is not on our approved list.."

```kql
let ApprovedMacs = dynamic(["00-14-22-01-23-45", "00-25-96-FF-FE-12-34", "00-0C-29-AB-CD-EF"]);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName contains "claude" or ProcessCommandLine contains "claude"
| join kind=inner (
    DeviceNetworkInfo
    | where PhysicalAddress !in (ApprovedMacs)
) on DeviceId
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessFileName, PhysicalAddress, ProcessCommandLine

```

### 2. Detecting Script-Based Automation

**Objective:** Find processes executing scripts that spawn network activity or modify system settings repeatedly.

**Query Description:**  
"Find processes that executed PowerShell or Python scripts which then spawned network connections or modified registry keys, especially if they did so repeatedly in short intervals."

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName in ("powershell.exe", "python.exe")
| join kind=inner (
    DeviceNetworkEvents
    | where Timestamp > ago(1d)
) on DeviceId, Timestamp
| summarize count() by DeviceName, InitiatingProcessFileName, bin(Timestamp, 5m)
| where count_ > 5
```

### 3. Automated Isolation Playbooks

**Objective:** Automatically isolate devices exhibiting Claude-like behavior and notify the incident response team.

**Strategy Description:**  
"If a device is making repeated calls to Claude-related domains and executing scripts, isolate it immediately and notify the incident response team."

This can be implemented using Sentinel playbooks integrated with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Teams.

## AWS-Based Defensive Notes

For organizations operating in AWS environments:

- Use **GuardDuty** to detect unusual API activity
- Monitor **CloudTrail** for Lambda invocations targeting external endpoints
- Enforce outbound traffic restrictions via **AWS Config**

**Strategy Description:**  
"Alert me if any Lambda function sends data to an external domain containing 'claude' or 'anthropic'."

This can be achieved using CloudWatch alarms and Security Hub integrations.

## Conclusion

As defenders we must shift from signature-based detection to behavior-based analysis. With Microsoft Sentinel and AWS-native tools, we can build resilient systems that detect intent, not just activity.

Detection is no longer about what was done. It’s about why—and by whom.
